`UIPanGestureRecognizer(context: `[`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html)`)`

UIPanGestureRecognizer is a subclass of UIGestureRecognizer that looks for panning (dragging) gestures. The user must
be pressing one or more fingers on a view while they pan it. Clients implementing the action method for this gesture
recognizer can ask it for the current translation and velocity of the gesture.
