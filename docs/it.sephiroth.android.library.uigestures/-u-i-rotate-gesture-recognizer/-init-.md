`UIRotateGestureRecognizer(context: `[`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html)`)`

UIRotationGestureRecognizer is a subclass of UIGestureRecognizer that looks for rotation gestures involving two
touches. When the user moves the fingers opposite each other in a circular motion, the underlying view should rotate in a
corresponding direction and speed.
