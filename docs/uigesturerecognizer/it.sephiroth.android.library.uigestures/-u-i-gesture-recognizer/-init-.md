`UIGestureRecognizer(context: `[`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html)`)`

AndroidGestureRecognizer is an Android implementation
of the Apple's UIGestureRecognizer framework. There's not guarantee, however, that
this library works 100% in the same way as the Apple version.
This is the base class for all the UI gesture implementations.
