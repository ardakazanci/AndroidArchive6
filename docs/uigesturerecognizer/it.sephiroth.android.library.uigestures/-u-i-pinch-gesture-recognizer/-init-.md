`UIPinchGestureRecognizer(context: `[`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html)`)`

UIPinchGestureRecognizer is a subclass of UIGestureRecognizer that looks for pinching gestures involving two touches.
When the user moves the two fingers toward each other, the conventional meaning is zoom-out; when the user moves the two
fingers away from each other, the conventional meaning is zoom-in.
