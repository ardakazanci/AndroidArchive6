| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.OnGestureRecognizerStateChangeListener](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-on-gesture-recognizer-state-change-listener/index.md) | Created by alessandro crugnola on 11/20/16. |
| [android.graphics.Point](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/android.graphics.-point/index.md) (extensions in package it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures) |  |
| [android.graphics.PointF](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/android.graphics.-point-f/index.md) (extensions in package it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures) |  |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.ScaleGestureDetector](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-scale-gesture-detector/index.md) | This is a slightly modified version of the Android's ScaleGestureDetector which doesn't trigger onScaleEnd when the scale ratio is back to 0. |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UIContinuousRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-continuous-recognizer.md) | Created by Alessandro Crugnola on 11/20/16 |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UIDiscreteGestureRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-discrete-gesture-recognizer.md) | Created by Alessandro Crugnola on 11/20/16 |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UIGestureRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-gesture-recognizer/index.md) | AndroidGestureRecognizer is an Android implementation of the Apple's UIGestureRecognizer framework. There's not guarantee, however, that this library works 100% in the same way as the Apple version. This is the base class for all the UI gesture implementations. |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UIGestureRecognizerDelegate](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-gesture-recognizer-delegate/index.md) |  |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UILongPressGestureRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-long-press-gesture-recognizer/index.md) | UILongPressGestureRecognizer looks for long-press gestures. The user must press one or more fingers on a view and hold them there for a minimum period of time before the action triggers. While down, the userâ€™s fingers may not move more than a specified distance; if they move beyond the specified distance, the gesture fails. |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UIPanGestureRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-pan-gesture-recognizer/index.md) | UIPanGestureRecognizer is a subclass of UIGestureRecognizer that looks for panning (dragging) gestures. The user must be pressing one or more fingers on a view while they pan it. Clients implementing the action method for this gesture recognizer can ask it for the current translation and velocity of the gesture. |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UIPinchGestureRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-pinch-gesture-recognizer/index.md) | UIPinchGestureRecognizer is a subclass of UIGestureRecognizer that looks for pinching gestures involving two touches. When the user moves the two fingers toward each other, the conventional meaning is zoom-out; when the user moves the two fingers away from each other, the conventional meaning is zoom-in. |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UIRectEdge](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-rect-edge/index.md) |  |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UIRotateGestureRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-rotate-gesture-recognizer/index.md) | UIRotationGestureRecognizer is a subclass of UIGestureRecognizer that looks for rotation gestures involving two touches. When the user moves the fingers opposite each other in a circular motion, the underlying view should rotate in a corresponding direction and speed. |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-screen-edge-pan-gesture-recognizer/index.md) | UIPanGestureRecognizer is a subclass of UIGestureRecognizer that looks for panning (dragging) gestures. The user must be pressing one or more fingers on a view while they pan it. Clients implementing the action method for this gesture recognizer can ask it for the current translation and velocity of the gesture. |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UISwipeGestureRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-swipe-gesture-recognizer/index.md) | UISwipeGestureRecognizer is a subclass of UIGestureRecognizer that looks for swiping gestures in one or more directions. A swipe is a discrete gesture, and thus the associated action message is sent only once per gesture. |
| [it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures.UITapGestureRecognizer](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/-u-i-tap-gesture-recognizer/index.md) | UITapGestureRecognizer looks for single or multiple taps. For the gesture to be recognized, the specified number of fingers must tap the view a specified number of times. |
| [android.view.View](../it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures/android.view.-view/index.md) (extensions in package it.sephiroth.android.library.uigestures) |  |
